# Lab9-GraphSearch
Give the input edges in the file:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s8SY3jB3A3S36gqfgKnQ6QA935MQr2xz/view?usp=sharing

- The file has 1 edge per line in the format (origin,destination)

- Assume the graph is not directional

- (2,5) means there is a path from 2 to 5 and from 5-2

For the Lab write the following code.

1) Write a function to find all adjacent vertices to a node N ( find_adjacent(n))

2) Write a function that will return true or false that an edge exists ( edge_exists(origin,destination))

3) Print out all Vertices using BFS
